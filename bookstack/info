Yea, so when building on raspberrypi you seem to have to run mysql without root password, with the `DB_HOST` variable a port is only required if it's not the default one (3306).
Also to stop the container from exiting (most of the time with `exited with code 124`) you have to change the timeout in the `docker-entrypoint.sh` from 15 to 30:

```
echoerr "wait-for-db: waiting for ${DB_HOST_NAME}:${DB_PORT}"

timeout __30__ bash <<EOT
while ! (echo > /dev/tcp/${DB_HOST_NAME}/${DB_PORT}) >/dev/null 2>&1;
    do sleep 1;
```
and the sleep time from 1 sec to 10:
```

if [ $RESULT -eq 0 ]; then
  # sleep another second for so that we don't get a "the database system is starting up" error
  sleep __10__
  echoerr "wait-for-db: done"
```


I am pretty sure that this does not actually fix the bug, but only circumvents the problem.
